# Overview

At Scalio, a primary goal for 2019 is to move 100% of our application builds over to Bazel - every language & platform. This work has already begun for many of the platforms we ship code for, and this document tracks the status of this effort here at Scalio, as well as serves as an example of our typical strategy when moving organizations over to Bazel.

# Playbook

We execute this process using a standard playbook both internally here on our projects and when engaged by clients to help with this effort.

The workflow consists of 3 stages, each of which consists of a few steps. The stages align to our level of support and adoption of Bazel for a given platform or language.

## Status Workflow

- ðŸ”´ **Canary** - _proof of concept phase_
  - evaluate existing support for Bazel
  - initial creation of toolchains, build rules drafts
  - initial definition of knowledgebase and internal best practices
  - begin onboarding the platform team "early adopters"
- ðŸ’› **Development** - _building out full Bazel support_
  - refine build rules
  - define boilerplate project workspaces (BUILD files) for projects on this platform
  - build all new projects on this platform with bazel
  - continue migration process
  - finalize best practices and knowledgebase
  - platform team fully onboarded
  - PRs to Bazel OSS repos with necessary changes to the tool itself, build rules, and docs
  - implement remote cache integration
  - implement rbe integration
- ðŸ’š **Stable** - _builds with Bazel are fully supported and the norm for the platform_
  - 100% of projects building on Bazel
  - all current use cases supported

In practice, the Bazel rollout is tracked using Kanban and the above workflow, where each platform is a task, each item above is a checklist item, and each Status is a column.

# Bazel Support Status at Scalio

## ðŸ’š Golang

All Golang applications are built with Bazel and the platform teams are fully onboarded and up to speed on our best practices.

### Issues

- [Missing $GOPATH with pure="on" enabled](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go/issues/1987)

### Links and Resources

Scalio's contributions to Golang + Bazel will be publicly listed here soon.

## ðŸ’š NodeJS (Nest)

New NestJS apps are built with Bazel, and the team is being onboarded rapidly.

### Issues

- [Building linux amd64 nodejs_image on Mac OS](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/396) | [related pull request](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/pull/827)

### Links and Resources

- [NestJS starter repo](https://github.com/scalio/bazel-nestjs-starter)

## ðŸ’› Angular 8

Angular builds on Bazel are being evaluated and the tooling implemented.

### Links and Resources

Scalio's contributions to Angular + Bazel will be publicly listed here soon.

## ðŸ’š Docker

Docker and Bazel support is in use for all Golang apps and some NestJS apps. Rollout is ongoing to legacy applications.

### Links and Resources

Scalio's contributions to Docker + Bazel will be publicly listed here soon.

## ðŸ’› Android

We've created starter repositories for Java and Kotlin Android projects. For Kotlin 1.3 features and coroutines we've implemented custom rules. Also we've fixed some minor issues that were blocking us from building starter projects. But we are not able to use Bazel for all new projects (and migrate old ones) because we are blocked on on [Android DataBinding support](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2694).

### Links and Resources

- [Bazel-Android-Starter-Kotlin](https://github.com/scalio/Android-Bazel-Starter-Kotlin) - A Bazel & Android starter project running latest Kotlin (1.3.+) with coroutines support.
- [Bazel-Android-Starter-Java](https://github.com/scalio/Android-Bazel-Starter-Java) - A Bazel & Android starter project running Java.
- [Kotlin Build Rules](https://github.com/mig35/rules_kotlin) - our updated Kotlin build rules with full support for Kotlin 1.3, Coroutines, and Annotations.

## ðŸ”´ iOS

Our iOS support is in canary phase as we continue to work on tooling around package managers (SPM, CocoaPods) etc.

### Links and Resources

[PodToBuild by Pinterest](https://github.com/pinterest/PodToBUILD) - A promising and useful tool for making use of CocoaPods within Bazel builds, however there's still room for improvement here, and SPM should be preferred wherever possible.

## ðŸ’š C++

Bazel is used for all new C++ projects, all meaningful legacy projects have been updated, and the team is onboarded.

### ðŸ’› Djinni

Early Bazel support has been achieved and we are now refining this tooling and moving towards production-ready status.

#### Links and Resources

Scalio's contributions to C++ & Djinni + Bazel will be publicly listed here soon.

## ðŸ”´ Rust

Overview coming soon.

### Links and Resources

Scalio's contributions to Rust + Bazel will be publicly listed here soon.

## ðŸ’› .NET Core

Scalio's .NET Core team is happy with the results we've seen with Bazel so far and full production-ready Bazel support is coming soon.

### Links and Resources

- [.NET Core starter repo](https://github.com/scalio/bazel-dotnetcore-starter)

## ðŸ”´ JVM

The JVM team is currently ramping up on Bazel.

### Links and Resources

Scalio's contributions to JVM + Bazel will be publicly listed here soon.
